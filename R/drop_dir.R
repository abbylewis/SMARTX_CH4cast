#' List folder contents and associated metadata.
#'
#' Can be used to either see all items in a folder, or only items that have changed since a previous request was made.
#'
#' @param path path to folder in Dropbox to list contents of. Defaults to the root directory.
#' @param recursive If TRUE, the list folder operation will be applied recursively to all subfolders and the response will contain contents of all subfolders. Defaults to FALSE.
#' @param include_media_info If TRUE, FileMetadata.media_info is set for photo and video. Defaults to FALSE.
#' @param include_deleted If TRUE, the results will include entries for files and folders that used to exist but were deleted. Defaults to FALSE.
#' @param include_has_explicit_shared_members If TRUE, the results will include a flag for each file indicating whether or not that file has any explicit members. Defaults to FALSE.
#' @param include_mounted_folders If TRUE, the results will include entries under mounted folders which includes app folder, shared folder and team folder. Defaults to TRUE.
#' @param limit The maximum number of results to return per request. Note: This is an approximate number and there can be slightly more entries returned in some cases. Defaults to NULL, no limit.
#' @param cursor string or boolean: \itemize{
#'   \item{If FALSE, return metadata of items in \code{path}}
#'   \item{If TRUE, return a cursor to be used for detecting changed later}
#'   \item{If a string, return metadata of changed items since the cursor was fetched}
#' }
#' @template token
#'
#' @return Either a \code{tbl_df} of items in folder, one row per file or folder, with metadata values as columns, or a character string giving a cursor to be used later for change detection (see \code{cursor}).

  #
  # Implements a recursive algorithm to linearize nested lists upto any
  # arbitrary level of nesting (limited by R's allowance for recursion-depth).
  # By linearization, it is meant to bring all list branches emanating from
  # any nth-nested trunk upto the top-level trunk s.t. the return value is a
  # simple non-nested list having all branches emanating from this top-level
  # branch.
  #
  # Since dataframes are essentially lists a boolean option is provided to
  # switch on/off the linearization of dataframes. This has been found
  # desirable in the author's experience.
  #
  # Also, one'd typically want to preserve names in the lists in a way as to
  # clearly denote the association of any list element to it's nth-level
  # history. As such we provide a clean and simple method of preserving names
  # information of list elements. The names at any level of nesting are
  # appended to the names of all preceding trunks using the `NameSep` option
  # string as the seperator. The default `/` has been chosen to mimic the unix
  # tradition of filesystem hierarchies. The default behavior works with
  # existing names at any n-th level trunk, if found; otherwise, coerces simple
  # numeric names corresponding to the position of a list element on the
  # nth-trunk. Note, however, that this naming pattern does not ensure unique
  # names for all elements in the resulting list. If the nested lists had
  # non-unique names in a trunk the same would be reflected in the final list.
  # Also, note that the function does not at all handle cases where `some`
  # names are missing and some are not.
  #
  # Clearly, preserving the n-level hierarchy of branches in the element names
  # may lead to names that are too long. Often, only the depth of a list
  # element may only be important. To deal with this possibility a boolean
  # option called `ForceNames` has been provided. ForceNames shall drop all
  # original names in the lists and coerce simple numeric names which simply
  # indicate the position of an element at the nth-level trunk as well as all
  # preceding trunk numbers.
  #
  # Returns:
  # LinearList: Named list.
